      All right, friends. Let’s do this. This section will cover basic,
      frequently asked questions for e-commerce merchants.

    questions:
      - question: How long does shipping take?
        answer: >-
          Now that’s a frequent one all right, ain’t it? Your answer to this
          should *manage customer expectations*. Just like [a good checkout
          flow](http://bit.ly/2YCN3iG) should. Tell them the truth:

            - US shipping will take between 3 to 5 business days.
            - International shipping will take between 5 and 10 business days.
            - Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s Twitter account.
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >
          It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint
          *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:


          *   All discounted items sales are final.

          *   If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return
          label. Instructions are printed on its back.

          *   If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at
          info@alisolanki.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!
      - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?
        answer: >

          am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data
          handling process. Or, if you’re using, just refer to [our ToS and
          DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt).
      - question: Rapid-fire questions
        answer: >
          Q: Why is this Planty theme so beautiful?  A: We hired our first
          designer a couple of months ago.




          Q: What’s the meaning of life?  A: We’re not quite sure. But building
          useful products with people we love feels meaningful enough.
